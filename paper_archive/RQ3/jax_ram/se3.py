    Notes:
        In Euclidean space, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 is a tool which takes two points 𝑝1,𝑝2, “adds” them, and generates a third, larger point
        𝑝3. Addition gives us a way to “move forward” in Euclidean space. On manifolds, the 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 provides a tool,
        which “takes the exponential of the tangent vector at point 𝑝” to generate a third point on the manifold.
        The exponential does this by
        1) identifying the unique geodesic 𝛾 that goes through 𝑝 and 𝑣𝑝,
        2) identifying the “length” 𝑙 of the tangent vector 𝑣𝑝, and
        3) calculating another point 𝑝′ along 𝛾⁡(𝑡) that is a “distance” 𝑙 from the initial point 𝑝.
        Note again that the notion of “length” and “distance” is different on a manifold than it is in Euclidean space
        and that quantifying length is not something that we will be able to do without specifying a metric.
